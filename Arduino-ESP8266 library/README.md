# Library for ESP8266 in the Arduino IDE - How to configure it?

You must prepare the codes of this library changing the next variables:

Set the ssid and password for your WiFi connection:
```
const char* ssid = "your-wifi-ssid";
const char* password = "your-wifi-password";
```
Set the API's URL using the Firebase project ID that you got during the API deploy.
```
const char* host = "us-central1-[id].cloudfunctions.net";
```
Set the unique device ID.
```
char* id = "light";
```

##### Important

Authorization_code is autogenerated by now. It is the something like:

```
[device-id]-code
```

For example, if the device id is `light` the authorization_code that you must set in the database is:

```
light-code
```
